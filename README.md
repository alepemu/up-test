# up-test

### About

This is a web app exercise that contains two screens:

- <u>Area Selector</u>: Introduce some coordinates and a map below will show the location. In the map there is a marker with a circle area that can be modified with a slider bar. If you grant the right permissions, the coordinates by default will be the device's geo-location.

- <u>Weather City</u>: There is a city selector containing a small list of towns. Once there is a city selected, the weather card below will show the current weather conditions retrieved from the Open Weather API.
